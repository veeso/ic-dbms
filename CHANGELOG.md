## 0.4.0

Released on 2026-02-06

- New features:
  - [Issue 13](https://github.com/veeso/ic-dbms/issues/13): Added JSON filtering capabilities for querying JSON columns.
    - `JsonFilter::Contains` for PostgreSQL `@>` style structural containment checks
    - `JsonFilter::Extract` for extracting values at JSON paths with comparison operations
    - `JsonFilter::HasKey` for checking path existence in JSON structures
    - Path syntax supports dot notation with bracket array indices (e.g., `user.items[0].name`)
  - [Issue 22](https://github.com/veeso/ic-dbms/issues/22): Added `AgentClient` for the ic-dbms-canister to interact with
    the IC from an IC Agent.
- Performance improvements:
  - [Issue 11](https://github.com/veeso/ic-dbms/issues/11): Implemented in-place update instead of delete+insert strategy
    ([#37](https://github.com/veeso/ic-dbms/pull/37)).
    - Records whose size is unchanged are now overwritten directly in stable memory, avoiding unnecessary reallocation.
    - Records whose size changes still fall back to delete+reinsert.
    - Added `UpdateIntegrityValidator` that allows keeping the same primary key during updates.
    - Cascade primary key changes to referencing tables via `update_pk_referencing_updated_table`.
    - Extracted shared validation logic into `integrity::common` module.
  - Replaced the external `like` crate with a custom SQL LIKE pattern engine ([#42](https://github.com/veeso/ic-dbms/pull/42)).
    - The new iterative two-pointer algorithm runs in O(n*m) worst-case with O(1) space and zero heap allocation, replacing the previous recursive approach that had exponential worst-case complexity.
- Bug fixes:
  - Fixed an issue with the IcCanisterClient which called `update` with the wrong amount of arguments.
  - Fixed multi-column `order_by` applying sorts in the wrong order, causing only the last column's sort to survive
    ([#39](https://github.com/veeso/ic-dbms/pull/39)).
- Refactoring:
  - Moved workspace crates into `crates/` directory for better project organization
  ([#38](https://github.com/veeso/ic-dbms/pull/38)).
  - Cleaned up `dbms.rs` with extracted helpers, immutable borrow fixes, and moved tests to a separate file
  ([#40](https://github.com/veeso/ic-dbms/pull/40)).
  - Reorganized and expanded project documentation ([#31](https://github.com/veeso/ic-dbms/pull/31)).
  - Increased test coverage for ic-dbms-api, ic-dbms-canister, and ic-dbms-client.
- Dependencies:
  - [Issue 12](https://github.com/veeso/ic-dbms/issues/12): Bump pocket-ic to 12.0.0.

## 0.3.0

Released on 2025-12-24

- [Field Sanitizers](https://github.com/veeso/ic-dbms/pull/7): it is now possible to tag fields for sanitization.
  Sanitizers can be specified in the schema and will be executed before inserting or updating records.
  - The library comes with built-in sanitizers for common use cases (e.g., trimming whitespace, converting to
    lowercase).
- [Memory Alignment](https://github.com/veeso/ic-dbms/pull/15): Changed the previous memory model which used to store
  records sequentially in a contiguous block of memory with padded fields to a more efficient model that aligns fields
  based on their data types. This change improves memory access speed and reduces fragmentation.
  - [Added a new `MemoryError::OffsetNotAligned`](https://github.com/veeso/ic-dbms/pull/16) variant to handle cases
    where field offsets are not properly aligned
    when writing, which notifies memory corruptions issues.
- [Int8, Int16, Uint8, Uint16 data types](https://github.com/veeso/ic-dbms/pull/17): Added support for smaller integer
  types to optimize memory usage
  and improve performance for applications that require precise control over data sizes.
- [Added `From` implementation for `Value` for inner types](https://github.com/veeso/ic-dbms/pull/18): `i8`, `i16`,
  `i32`, `i64`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`,
  `&[u8]`, `Vec<u8>`, `Principal`, `rust_decimal::Decimal`, `Uuid`, which
  automatically builds the corresponding `Value` variant when converting from these types.
  - Added `FromStr`, `From<&str>`, and `From<String>` implementations for `Value`, which automatically builds a
    `Value::Text`
    variant when converting from string types.
- [FreeSegmentLedger now uses many pages](https://github.com/veeso/ic-dbms/pull/20): The FreeSegmentLedger has been
  updated to utilize multiple pages for tracking free segments.
  This enhancement allows for the free segments ledger to grow and not to die when a single page is full.
  - Added logic to handle reading and writing free segments across multiple pages.
  - Updated tests to cover scenarios involving multiple pages in the FreeSegmentLedger.

## 0.2.1

Released on 2025-12-23

- TableReader never read following pages when reading a table. #5c0ffe6f

## 0.2.0

Released on 2025-12-21

- [Field Validation](https://github.com/veeso/ic-dbms/pull/6): it is now possible to tag fields for validation.
  Validators can be specified in the schema and will be executed before inserting or updating records.
  - The library comes with built-in validators for common use cases (e.g., email, URL, number range).

## 0.1.0

Released on 2025-12-11

- First stable release.
